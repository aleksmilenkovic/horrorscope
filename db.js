      "Sorry, Aries, but you can't help yourself. As the trailblazing first sign of the Zodiac, you need to investigate that odd sound or otherworldly light — even if it leads to the doom of the group. Your bravery and confidence are normally admirable traits, but in a horror movie, caution almost always wins over impulse. Only time will tell how far you make it, but has anyone ever told you the one about curiosity and the cat?",

You suggest that they should turn back, call the police, or at the very least get someone's mom, yet your practical pleas are almost always ignored. If you're lucky, you'll be there at the end of the movie to say a satisfying (and perfectly Taurean) 'I told you so.'",

      "We like to call you a 'versatile' sign, Gemini, for how seamlessly you move from social group to social group, matching your energy and communication style to those around you. It's a gift, really, but this talent could very well be what leaves you open to psychic or satanic possession if you were plunked down into The Exorcist. You'd probably be just as chatty, but way scarier.",

Sensitive sign that you are, you have a tendency to be misunderstood. Your hard outer shell, aka your desire for a private, inner life can lead others to believe that you're much pricklier than you really are. Beneath that exterior, you're a big softie who (usually) just wants a hug.",

And there's only one sign that comes to mind when we think of these silly yet sinister characters: Leo, the sign that taught us there's no such thing as bad publicity. Your magnetic sign isn't one to shy away from the spotlight, even if it means chewing a bit of scenery. No matter how evil you seem, half the audience is still rooting for you.",

You lend much-needed ambiance to any creepy old house, but we probably won't find you actively terrorizing any unfortunate visitors. You leave that up to whatever other entities are hiding in the walls. You? You have more important work to do, like streamlining the dinner service.",

Whatever your exact role is will depend on the movie, but, simply, you're the fortunate soul whose innocence and naivety saves them. A slight variation on this character is, in some films, you only seem innocent — and end up kicking the most butt out of anyone in order to make to the end credits.",

This is the reputation Scorpios are doomed to live with: that of the quiet, secretive type whose dark sense of humor leads others to believe that they really are up to no good.
